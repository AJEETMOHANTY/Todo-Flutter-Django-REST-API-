Developed a Todo mobile application with the following features:

* Tech Stack: Flutter, Dart, Django REST Framework, SQLite, HTTP.

* Users can add, delete, and view tasks in real-time using a RESTful API.

* Used Django as the backend with custom API endpoints for CRUD operations.

* Implemented data visualization using a Pie Chart to represent task completion status.
